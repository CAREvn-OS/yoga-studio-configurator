  'about-p1': [
    'Founded in 2018, our studio brings together certified yoga and Pilates instructors in a purpose-built space designed for focused, effective practice. Every class is thoughtfully structured to balance challenge with recovery.',
    'What started as a tiny pop-up in a rented loft has grown into something we\u2019re incredibly proud of \u2014 a bright, welcoming studio where friendships form over post-class smoothies and breakthroughs happen every single day.',
    'Conceived by a team of movement professionals and interior architects, the studio pairs world-class instruction with a meticulously designed environment \u2014 from the sustainably sourced oak floors to the custom-blended essential-oil diffusers.',
    'We opened our doors because we believed the city needed a studio that didn\u2019t take itself too seriously. A space where first-timers feel just as welcome as seasoned practitioners, and where laughter is as common as deep breaths.',
    'We didn\u2019t start this studio to follow trends. We built it to deliver outcomes. Our programming is informed by sports science, physiotherapy research, and thousands of hours of real-world teaching.',
    'This studio was born from a simple question: what would happen if we slowed down long enough to truly listen \u2014 to our bodies, our breath, and each other? Six years later, that question still guides everything we do.',
  ],

  'about-p2': [
    'Our method integrates classical yoga alignment with contemporary Pilates biomechanics, giving you a well-rounded practice that strengthens, lengthens, and restores. Classes are capped at 16 to ensure personal attention.',
    'We keep our classes small because we genuinely care about every person in the room. Our instructors learn your name, remember your injuries, and celebrate your wins \u2014 big or small.',
    'With a maximum of twelve participants per session, every class delivers the attentiveness of a private lesson within an inspiring group setting. Premium equipment from Balanced Body and Manduka ensures an uncompromising experience.',
    'Our sliding-scale pricing, free community classes, and partnership with local nonprofits mean that finances are never a barrier. Movement is a right, not a privilege, and our schedule reflects that belief.',
    'Every class follows a progressive structure: targeted warm-up, skill development, peak challenge, and guided cool-down. This isn\u2019t random sequencing \u2014 it\u2019s periodized programming that compounds week over week.',
    'We draw from Hatha, Vinyasa, and Iyengar traditions alongside Joseph Pilates\u2019 original principles, weaving breathwork and meditation into every session so that the practice extends far beyond the mat.',
  ],

  'about-p3': [
    'Whether your goal is injury rehabilitation, athletic cross-training, or simply a midweek reset, our diverse timetable and experienced team are here to support you at every stage.',
    'This isn\u2019t a franchise and it never will be. It\u2019s a labor of love run by real humans who happen to be obsessed with helping people feel better in their bodies. Come see the difference that makes.',
    'From the moment you step through our doors, every detail has been considered \u2014 chilled eucalyptus towels, complimentary herbal teas, Malin+Goetz amenities, and a serene lounge designed for lingering.',
    'We\u2019re proud to be a certified inclusive space. Our instructors hold accessibility training certifications, and adaptive equipment is available in every class. If you can breathe, you belong here.',
    'Our members report a 40% improvement in functional strength within 12 weeks. But numbers only tell part of the story \u2014 ask anyone here about the confidence, energy, and sleep quality they\u2019ve gained.',
    'The practice we share is not about perfecting a pose. It\u2019s about cultivating awareness \u2014 the kind that follows you off the mat and into the way you parent, work, love, and rest.',
